# Budget app

## Things I should be able to do

1. Create an account
2. Log in
3. Create, Read, Update and Delete a wallet
4. Wallets, transactions and categories

- You can initialize a wallet with some balance, as well as update it manually without generating a new transaction
- Generate transactions between wallets, for example if I send USDT from my Metamask wallet to my hardware wallet.
- Update and delete should be able to be done.
- Users can create their own categories
